Usage:

```csharp
// Init a new instance
MovieMetaEngine.IMovieMetaSearch search = new OfdbParser.OfdbMovieMetaSearch();

// Search a movie by barcode
List<MovieMetaEngine.MovieMetaMovieModel> barcodeResult = search.SearchMovieByBarcode("EANBarcode");

// Search a movie by title
List<MovieMetaEngine.MovieMetaMovieModel> titleResult = search.SearchMovieByTitle("MovieTitle");

// Search a movie by engine id
List<MovieMetaEngine.MovieMetaMovieModel> titleResult = search.SearchMovieByEngineId("EngineId");
```

If you search a movie by its title, be aware that you probably need the complete title and the correct spelling and synthax.
When using OFDB the movie "The Avengers" is stored as "Avengers, The" for example. 
You probably have to search this way round for getting a match.

You could also init a search using the "OFDB Gateway XML / JSON Interface" (http://www.ofdbgw.org/). 
This is what I've first integrated but I found that the gateway was not reliable for me. 
So this is not maintained any longer.

```csharp
// Init a new instance
MovieMetaEngine.IMovieMetaSearch search = new OfdbWebGatewayConnector.OfdbWgMovieMetaSearch();
```

The UIs within the solution are for testing purpose only and by no means intended for production.
